TO USE:

This app was created in memory of multiple packages of expired lettuce.

I wanted to create an app that would let me keep track of what is going to expire so I no longer have to throw away briefly-forgotten letucce. 

Input a food item and expiration date and it will be added to your current list of food (which is sorted chronologically by expiration date). If the food is within 3 days of expiring, the text will show up green. If the food has passed the expiration date, the text will show up red.

If you eat a food product or it goes bad, you can click either the "Ate" or "Spoiled" button below the item. This adds to a counter to keep track of how many food items you have eaten or let spoil. 

If you create multiple items with the same name, the duplicates will have "*" added to their names.
